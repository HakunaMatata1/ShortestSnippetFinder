ShortestSnippetFinder
=====================

An app that goes through any user input text and takes user input search terms to find the shortest bit of the body that 
contains all the search terms.

No real reason, I used php over any other language. But specifically after this project, I realized the importance of using 
a language that has a good method for debugging. And also the importance of a convenient method to showcase a demo and your 
code to someone.


I got the program to work with the correct logic, and it was so frustrating debugging with simple prints and checking 
letter by letter for errors. Especially with PHP, because I was working on notepad++ and simply running it on a server 
to see if it could work. It wasn't until after the project that I discovered PHP Tools for Visual Studio that lets you 
step into the code. It was also through step into that I was able to find other bugs that would show up.

SO IMPORTANT and HELPFUL
